<h1>Finalize spaceholding</h1>

About: A spacepirate is finalizing participations/spaceholding after the event is done. After submit, will payout people with tokens.<br/>
A spacepirate can do this only for events he is a team member for.<br/>
<br/>
Content:
<ul>
    <li>Details of event</li>
    <li>List of all team members with checkboxes (pre-checked with those claimed spaceholding before).</li>
    <li>Button to add non-team members (watch out, if this leaves page, then data will be lost!).</li>
    <li>Button to submit.</li>
</ul>

Will be interesting if this is going to be changed once it was submited ;)
